# Metric-Alarm-Clock
Arduino based metric alarm clock

This is just to host my metric alarm clock code. I don't know if it's really useful for anyone to use, but feel free to if you want. Also the timing method isn't very accurate, so if you need a real clock, don't do it this way. I just did it this way to get something working.
